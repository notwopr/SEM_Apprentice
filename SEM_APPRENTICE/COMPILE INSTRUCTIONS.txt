COMPILE INSTRUCTIONS:

To properly compile SEM Apprentice into an EXE file do the following:

1. Go to folder containing the SEM Apprentice python scripts.

2. Remove all files and folders pertaining to previous pyinstaller compilations.
	a. Delete existing 'dist' folder.
	b. Delete existing 'build' folder.
	c. Delete SEM_Apprentice.spec
	d. Delete versionfile.txt

3. Create new versionfile.txt.  This file is needed by pyinstaller to populate the details tab in the Properties window when you right-click the EXE for more info.
	a. Open create_versioninfofile.py in editor.
	b. Update any parameters, including correct version number.
	c. Run it.  This will create a new versionfile.txt.
	d. Find the newly created versionfile.txt
	e. Move it into the same folder as the SEM Apprentice python scripts.

4. Open terminal in the folder location of SEM_Apprentice.py
5. Make sure you are in the same directory as SEM_Apprentice.py
6. Run the following: 

pyinstaller --clean --onefile --noconsole --icon mikey.ico --version-file=versionfile.txt SEM_Apprentice.py

7. Re-compile it again but this time with a modified .spec file to make sure icon is stored in the exe file.
	a. When you compile the app, it creates a .spec file in the same folder as the original scripts.
	b. Open the SEM_Apprentice.spec file in your editor and make the following changes:
		(1) Under Analysis(), change "datas=[]," to "datas=[('mikey.ico', '.')],"
		(2) Under EXE()... 
			(a)  change "a.binaries," to "a.binaries + [('mikey.ico', 'D:\SEM_Apprentice\SEM_APPRENTICE\mikey.ico', 'DATA')],"
			(b) change "icon=['mikey.ico']," to "icon='mikey.ico',"
	c. Delete the old 'dist' and 'builds' folders and run the following:
	pyinstaller SEM_Apprentice.spec

8. Make it Presentable
	a. The newly compiled SEM_Apprentice.exe is in the 'dist' folder.
	b. Copy the README.HTML file and paste a copy in the dist folder.
	c. Rename 'dist' to 'SEM Apprentice v.{whatever version #}'
	d. Zip the folder.
	e. Add zip file to the Builds folder.
	f. commit changes to repo to save the new build to the repo.
