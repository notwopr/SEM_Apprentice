__WELCOME TO SEM_APPRENTICE!__

**OVERVIEW**
Thank you for participating in this project to collect data that will be used to train an AI model which we hope will improve the experience of operating SEMs in the future.  As such, the program is designed to capture certain data as you operate your microscope software.  

The following data will be captured while running this program:
    --mouse actions
    --keyboard actions
    --screenshots of your screen when you click your mouse or possibly make certain keystrokes.

You may terminate this program at any point in time by simply moving your mouse cursor to the upper-left-hand corner of your screen and scrolling down.  You will then get a prompt to confirm you would like to terminate the program.

When you have finished using the program and have collected the data your SEM_Apprentice representative requested you collect, please contact them when you are ready to have them retrieve your data.

If you are at all concerned about the data being recorded, you may review the data yourself and decide whether to withhold or release any or all of the data to us.  You can find any recorded data in the SEMBOT_DATA folder which will be found in the same folder as this README file.  If there is no folder, that means no data has been collected.    

You have the right to not release to us any or all data recorded.
